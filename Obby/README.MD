# Obby System

The Obby System is a versatile tool designed to streamline the creation of obby stages in Roblox. With a host of features and customizability options, users can effortlessly design engaging and dynamic obby experiences. Some key features include:

- Kill Parts
- Fading In/Out
- Tweening Parts
- Raft System (Character Sticks To Part)
- Status Effects (Player Changes Such As WalkSpeed)

## Customizability

Almost every aspect of the Obby System is customizable, allowing users to tailor their obby stages to their liking. For instance, users can adjust the movement behavior of parts using settings such as Speed, Rotation, Distance, EasingDirection, and EasingStyle. Similarly, fading effects can be customized with settings like Visibility, Reverse (for fade-in effects), Speed, StallTime, ToggleCollide, and TouchActivated.
