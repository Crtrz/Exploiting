#Obby System

This is a system i made to quickly and efficiently create obby stages, it has features such as
+ Kill Parts
+ Fading In/Out
+ Tweening Parts
+ Raft System (Character Sticks To Part)
+Status Effects (Player Changes Such As WalkSpeed)
+Customizability

Nearly every feature is customisable, for example the way a part moves can be customised with settings such as Speed, Roation, Distance, EasingDirection, EasingStyle
Same with Fading, Fading has Visiblity(How Visible It Gets), Reverse (Make it appear instead of disapear), Speed, StallTime(Time Before Starting Again), ToggleCollide, TouchActivated
