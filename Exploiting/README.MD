# Warning
**I DO NOT ENDORSE EXPLOITING!**

## Explanation
In various Roblox games, a tool called "PompousTheCloud" was utilized. However, a vulnerability was discovered in its client-server design. This vulnerability allowed exploiters to execute commands such as `game.Player.LocalPlayer.Humanoid.Health = math.huge`, which is an obvious form of godmode. However, because it went through a remote, it became server-side!

```lua
local function CloudInvoke(Object, Prop, Value, Tool)
    Tool['ServerControl']:InvokeServer(
    "SetProperty",
        {
            ["Value"]=Value,
            ["Property"]=Prop,
            ["Object"]=Object
        }
    )
end
```

This method takes three arguments in a structure called "SetProperty".

### Value
The value represents the change you want to make, for example, from 1 to 100.

### Property
Property is the attribute you are modifying, such as Humanoid.Health.

### Object
Object is simply the instance you are targeting.

# Important
It's crucial to note that this exploit only allowed execution on anything that is a descendant of your Character Model, meaning you couldn't delete the map by just setting Map to null. (This doesn't mean it wasn't possible; it was just harder.)

# Examples

## Killing A Player
```lua
local function Kill(Player)
    local Accessory = Character:FindFirstChildOfClass("Accessory")
    local AccessoryHandle = Accessory:FindFirstChild("Handle")
    local AccessoryWeld = AccessoryHandle:FindFirstChild("AccessoryWeld")
    local CurrentWeldType = AccessoryWeld.Part1

    CloudInvoke(AccessoryWeld, "Part1", PlayerService[Player].Character.HumanoidRootPart, ServerControlRemote)
    CloudInvoke(AccessoryHandle, "CFrame", CFrame.new(0,-math.huge,0), ServerControlRemote)
    CloudInvoke(AccessoryWeld, "Part1", CurrentWeldType, ServerControlRemote)
end
```

## Freezing A Player
```lua
local function Freeze(Player)
    local Accessory = Character:FindFirstChildOfClass("Accessory")
    local AccessoryHandle = Accessory:FindFirstChild("Handle")
    local AccessoryWeld = AccessoryHandle:FindFirstChild("AccessoryWeld")

    CloudInvoke(AccessoryWeld, "Part1", PlayerService[Player].Character.HumanoidRootPart, ServerControlRemote)
    CloudInvoke(AccessoryHandle, "Anchored", true, ServerControlRemote)
end
```
