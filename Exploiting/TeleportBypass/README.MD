# Warning
**I DO NOT ENDORSE EXPLOITING!**

## Explanation
In the game "Booga Booga," one of Roblox's top anti-exploiting systems was implemented. However, a vulnerability was discovered in the anti-cheat system. This vulnerability allowed players to teleport for a brief moment after respawning.

The situation worsened because the game had a remote function that enabled instant respawning. Consequently, players could die, respawn, teleport, and repeat the process.

This exploit is particularly harmful because the game drops items on the ground. Exploiters taking advantage of this vulnerability could teleport and steal all the items, disrupting the game's balance.

# Note
The code is a complete mess due to its age and complexity.
